## Introduction to CI/CD and GitLab

### What is CI/CD:
1. CD part (3 stages): Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery) = Development + Testing + Production
   1. **Tests**
   2. **Build & Package**
   3. **Artifact repository**
2. CI part: Continuous Integration = 
   1. Developers merge their changes as often as possible
   2. So frequently, instead of waiting for release day
   3. Most important part is testing the application, that changes didn't break anything
   4. **Deploy to DEV**
   5. **Deploy to STAGING**
   6. **Deploy to PROD**
